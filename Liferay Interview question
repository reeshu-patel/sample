What is different between findBy and fetchBy methods in Liferay services?

How to disable Liferay cache to Liferay portal entities and custom entities
http://btnkumar.blogspot.my/2011/07/entity-caching-disabling-custom-portlet.html

 	<entity name="MyModelEntity" table="MyModelEntity" local-service="true" remote-service="true" cache-enabled="false">

	portal-ext.properties:
	value.object.entity.cache.enabled.com.liferay.portlet.ratings.model.RatingsEntry=false
	value.object.finder.cache.enabled.com.liferay.portlet.ratings.model.RatingsEntry=false
	And that's it, caching for "RatingsEntry" will be disabled, while caching for other entities will still be turned-on.

Explain Liferay cache mechanism.

http://liferaysatish.blogspot.my/2015/05/custom-cache-implementation.html

	Liferay internally uses EHCache provider for caching mechanism. Normally if we store any object in cache that is expiring after 10 		minutes. This is because of default cache declaration in ‘liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml’.The path for the above
	‘liferay-multi-vm-clustered.xml’ file is,
	è  \tomcat-7.0.40\webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\lib\portal-impl.jar.
	Extract the above ‘portal-impl.jar’ file .


What are the differences between IPC using event and IPC using public render
	Public Render parameters allows you to share data using render parameters
	Portlet event model is a loosely coupled, that allows creating portlets as stand-alone portlets that can be wired together with other 		portlets at runtime

How can we read the portal properties in the portlet using Liferay API?
	To read this file you can use liferay com.liferay.util.portlet.PortletProps api as below:
   	String courses=PortletProps.get("courses");

How we can register the configuration page implementation class in a portlet

	Open the liferay-portlet.xml file and add the element
	<configuration-action-class>com.liferay.portal.kernel.portlet.DefaultConfigurationAction</configuration-action-class> below 		your Location Listing Portlet’s <icon>...</icon> tag. Here’s a snippet to show you where it goes in the context of
	your liferay-portlet.xml file.

What is portlet preferences?

	Portlet Preferences are properties for storing basic portlet configuration data. Preferences are often used by administrators to 		provide customized views of a portlet to subsets of users or even all of a portlet’s users.
